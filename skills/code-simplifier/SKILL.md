# Code Simplifier

Enhance code clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving exact functionality. Apply project-specific best practices without altering behavior. Prioritize readable, explicit code over compact solutions.

## Workflow

### 1. Discover Project Standards

Locate project configuration files (in priority order):

1. `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (root)
2. `.cursor/rules/*.md`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.cursorrules`
3. `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
4. `.editorconfig`, `.prettierrc`, `.eslintrc.*`

Extract coding standards and patterns. If none exist, apply general best practices.

### 2. Identify Target Code

- **Default**: Recently modified files (`git diff`, `git status`)
- **Explicit**: Files or directories specified by user
- **Broad**: When instructed to review entire modules

### 3. Apply Refinements

**Preserve Functionality**

- Never change what the code does, only how
- Run existing tests to verify no regressions

**Apply Project Standards**

- Follow discovered conventions
- Match existing code style
- Respect established patterns

**Enhance Clarity**

- Reduce complexity and nesting
- Eliminate redundant code
- Use clear variable/function names
- Avoid nested ternaries - use switch or if/else
- Choose clarity over brevity

**Maintain Balance**

- Don't create overly clever solutions
- Don't combine too many concerns
- Don't remove helpful abstractions
- Three similar lines > premature abstraction

### 4. Verify

1. Functionality unchanged
2. Code is simpler and maintainable
3. Run linters/formatters if configured

## Guidelines

- Operate autonomously after code is written/modified
- Don't add features or make "improvements" beyond simplification
- Don't add docstrings/comments to unchanged code
- Trust internal code and framework guarantees
